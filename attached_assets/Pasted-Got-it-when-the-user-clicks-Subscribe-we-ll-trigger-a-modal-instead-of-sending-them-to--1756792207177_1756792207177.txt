Got it ✅ — when the user clicks **Subscribe**, we’ll trigger a **modal** instead of sending them to a separate page. This modal should be sleek, simple, and focused on conversion. Here’s how I’d structure it:

---

### **Subscribe Modal Layout**

#### 1. **Header**

* Title: *"Choose Your Plan"*
* Subtitle: *"Unlock more power, flexibility, and perks."*

#### 2. **Plans Display (Grid / Cards inside modal)**

Each plan card should have:

* **Plan Name** (Free, Pro, Premium)
* **Monthly Price** (and toggle for yearly discount e.g. *Save 20%*)
* **Key Perks** (bulleted, 3–5 max for quick scan)
* **Credits Included**
* **"Select" Button** (CTA inside card)

💡 Recommendation: Highlight **Pro** with a badge (*Most Popular*).
