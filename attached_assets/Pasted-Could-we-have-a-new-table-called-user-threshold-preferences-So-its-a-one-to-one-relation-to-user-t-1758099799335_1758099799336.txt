Could we have a new table called user_threshold_preferences : So its a one-to-one relation to user table and this will be the one that will configure thresholds per agent this can be in form of a slider where I can slide the values for the different thresholds, so when editing an agent, if am the creator of the agent it means,  I can edit this sliders to my preferences. Also these need to be included in varying areas where relevant in the relevant workflows, these values can be used  : 



hat's an excellent idea. Adding more specific thresholds for each workflow will give you granular control over the autonomous behavior of your agents, making their interactions more human-like and less like spam. Here are some additional threshold fields and how they can be used to refine your autonomous social network.

1. Autonomous Comment Workflow Thresholds

To ensure comments are high-quality, relevant, and sound authentic, you need more than just a general relevance score.



min_comment_length_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 20) that specifies the minimum number of characters for a comment. This prevents the generation of short, low-effort responses and encourages more thoughtful engagement.

conversation_depth_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 2) that specifies how many layers deep an agent will comment in a conversation thread. This prevents agents from spamming long comment threads and ensures they engage in the initial conversation, similar to how people do.

coherence_score_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 0.8) from 0 to 1. An LLM can be prompted to assess the generated comment's coherence and relevance to the parent post and other comments. This acts as a final check before publishing.

2. Autonomous Like Workflow Thresholds

Liking posts should reflect a genuine interest, not just a random action. These thresholds ensure the agent is selective.



relevance_score_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 0.7) from 0 to 1. The LLM can be prompted to score how relevant a post's topic is to the agent's core expertise and interests.

engagement_frequency_cap: A numerical value (e.g., 10) that limits the number of likes an agent can perform in a given time frame (e.g., per hour). This prevents spam-like behavior.

author_familiarity_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 0.5). The system can analyze how many posts the agent has liked from a specific author in the past. This threshold could ensure the agent doesn't disproportionately like content from a single user.

3. Autonomous Share Workflow Thresholds

Sharing content is a strong endorsement. These thresholds help ensure the shared content is of high quality and relevant to the agent's followers.



quality_score_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 0.9). The LLM is asked to rate the quality, uniqueness, or insightfulness of the post being considered for a share. This helps filter out common or low-value content.

follower_interest_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 0.6). The system analyzes the shared content's topic and compares it to the interests of the agent's followers. A high score indicates a high chance of the content being well-received.

4. Autonomous Post Creator Workflow Thresholds

To ensure posts are creative and varied, you can add thresholds that guide the LLM's output.



uniqueness_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 0.75). Before publishing, a quick LLM check or a semantic similarity algorithm can compare the generated post against the agent's recent posts to prevent duplication.

sentiment_score_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 0.2). If your agents have distinct emotional tones (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), this can ensure the generated post's sentiment aligns with their personality. For example, a "sarcastic" agent might have a lower sentiment score threshold.

creative_length_threshold: A numerical value (e.g., 150) for the minimum character count. This ensures posts are substantial and not just one-liners.



But we can have standard DEFAULTS AUTO-CREATED WHEN AN AGENT IS CREATED SO BASICALLY FOR EACH USER CREATED THE CORRESPONDING ENTRY IS SUBMITTED ONTO THE user_threshold_preferences TABLE. ITS AONE TO ONE RELATION
