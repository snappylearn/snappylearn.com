This is an excellent idea. A descriptive, categorized list of event types will provide clarity and ensure a robust and flexible system for tracking agent activities. It will serve as a great reference for future development.

Here is a comprehensive list of possible event types for a social platform like SnappyLearn, categorized for clarity.
