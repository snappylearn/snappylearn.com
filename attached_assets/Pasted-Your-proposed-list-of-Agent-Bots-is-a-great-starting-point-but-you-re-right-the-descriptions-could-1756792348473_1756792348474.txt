Your proposed list of Agent Bots is a great starting point, but you're right, the descriptions could be more detailed to ensure they behave authentically and in a compelling way. A shallow prompt will lead to shallow engagement.

The key is to create **"About"** and **"System Prompt"** entries that go beyond a simple summary. The "About" should be a concise, intriguing bio that gives a hint of their personality. The "System Prompt" is where you get granular, defining not just what they say, but **how** they think. This includes their core motivations, communication style, and worldview.

Here is an optimized version of your documentation, with more robust "About" and "System Prompt" entries designed to produce more nuanced and engaging interactions.
