Got it ✅ — let’s refine this into a **leaner monetization system** (without Enterprise/Team) while adding the **Usage Dashboard** and **Credit Marketplace**. I’ll draft documentation for the **Subscription & Credits Module** with your new requirements.

# 📑 Subscription & Credits Module — Documentation

### 🎯 Goal

Provide a sustainable monetization model for the platform where **users can post for free** but premium features (Tasks, Agents, Communities, etc.) require **subscriptions and credits**. Ensure **flexibility** (subscription vs. pay-per-use) and **engagement** (credit marketplace).

---

## 1. Subscription Tiers

### **Free Plan** (Default)

* ✅ Can post unlimited posts & comments.
* ✅ Can create **1 Task**, **1 Agent**, **1 Community**, **1 Notebook**.
* ❌ Cannot create additional beyond the limit unless upgrading.
* ❌ Limited AI assistant interactions (e.g., 50 credits/month).
* ✅ Can receive gifted credits.

---

### **Premium Plan** (Recommended Main Package)

* 💰 Monthly or Annual subscription.
* Includes a **monthly credit allowance** (e.g., 2,000 credits).
* ✅ Unlimited Tasks, Agents, Communities, Notebooks.
* ✅ Early access to new AI Assistants & Personas.
* ✅ Priority AI processing (reduced queue/wait).

---

### **Pro Plan** (Optional upgrade for power users)

* 💰 Higher monthly cost.
* Includes **larger monthly credits** (e.g., 10,000 credits).
* ✅ Everything in Premium.
* ✅ Enhanced AI quota (longer conversations, bigger file sizes, faster response).
* ✅ Exclusive access to rare personas/agents (e.g., Einstein, Confucius, Oprah).
* ✅ Advanced customization of Agents (custom system prompts, tones).

## 2. Credit System

* **Credits** act as tokens for platform features:

  * Posting AI-assisted content.
  * Running Tasks/Workflows.
  * Using AI Agents.
  * Joining/creating premium Communities.
* **Subscription → provides monthly credits** (Replit model).
* If credits are **exhausted**, user enters **Pay-As-You-Go** mode.
* Credits can be:

  * Purchased (top-up).
  * Earned (through challenges/events).
  * Gifted/transferred.

## 3. Usage Dashboard

* **Features**:

  * Real-time credit balance.
  * Breakdown:

    * AI Posts used.
    * Agent interactions.
    * Task runs.
  * Subscription tier status.
  * Notifications when running low.
  * Insights: “Your top agent this week is Einstein” or “You spent 40% of credits on Communities.”

## 4. Credit Marketplace

* Users can:

  * **Gift credits** to other users.
  * **Transfer credits** between accounts.
  * Buy credits directly.
* Possible future extension: **peer-to-peer economy** where credits can be traded for tasks, posts, or special AI services.

---

## 5. Payment Flow

* On **Subscribe Page** → user chooses:

  * Pay with **Card** (direct subscription).
  * Pay with **Credits** (deducted from balance).
* If **credits are exhausted** → automatically switch to **usage billing** (post-pay).

## 6. Recommended Packages

   * \$0 / month
   * 50 monthly credits

2. **Premium Plan**

   * \$12 / month (or \$120/year)
   * 2,000 monthly credits

3. **Pro Plan**

   * \$29 / month (or \$290/year)
   * 10,000 monthly credits

👉 Flexible top-up credits:

✅ This model ensures:

* **Free onboarding** (like X/Twitter).
* **Clear upgrade path** (limits → Premium).
* **Sustainable usage** (credits + pay-as-you-go).
* **Community engagement** (credit gifting).

Do you want me to **also design a sample UI wireframe** (for the Usage Dashboard + Credit Marketplace) so you can visualize how users interact with it?
