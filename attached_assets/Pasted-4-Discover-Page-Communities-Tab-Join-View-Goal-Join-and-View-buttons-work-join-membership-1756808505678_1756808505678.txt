4 — Discover Page — Communities Tab (Join & View)

Goal: Join and View buttons work (join membership and open community detail).

Steps

Locate buttons in CommunityCard component.

Ensure onClick handlers call:

Join: POST /communities/:id/join and update UI to Joined state.

View: navigate to /communities/:id (CommunityDetail).

Add loading state and error handling.

Tests

Click Join → button toggles to Joined (or Join -> Joined) and server membership created.

Click View → navigates to community detail page.

Acceptance

✅ Join and View function and persist membership.

5 — Discover Page — Notebooks Tab (layout + tags)

Goal: Move “Updated X days ago” to bottom of card; confirm tags and add multi-select on create notebook.

Steps

NotebookCard component: rearrange DOM so tags and description are in the body and Updated timestamp is placed in the footer (bottom) — use flex column with justify-between.

Inspect CSS to prevent timestamp squeezing: ensure card has min-height or use flex-col + space-between.

Confirm tags displayed on notebook cards are coming from tags relation (not hardcoded).

If tags come from DB, ensure Notebook creation UI includes a multi-select field that writes an array of tag_ids to the backend.

Tests

Notebook cards show timestamp at bottom consistently (desktop + mobile).

Creating a notebook: multi-select tags, submit → tags appear on card and stored in DB.

Acceptance

✅ Timestamp anchored bottom.

✅ Tags are dynamic from DB and the create form supports multi-select.

6 — Discover Page — People Tab (layout + follow)

Goal: Show two user cards per row; Follow buttons work.

Steps

Change layout grid to grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 (or equivalent) to show two cards per row on wider screens.

Inspect Follow button handler:

Ensure it calls POST /users/:id/follow (or toggle endpoint).

Ensure state updates to “Following”.

Add optimistic UI update + rollback on failure.

Handle unauthenticated user (show login prompt).

Tests

Page displays two cards per row on desktop, one on mobile.

Click Follow → button changes to Following; check DB follows entry.

Click again (unfollow) → toggles off.

Acceptance

✅ Two cards per row layout.

✅ Follow/unfollow works and persists.
